-f "Sentinel Mastery|You’ve mastered techniques to take advantage of every drop in any enemy’s guard; in tight spaces you are indomitable. You gain the following benefits:

 -Creatures within your reach provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action.
 -When you take the Dodge action, once per round, you can take two reactions on the same turn, instead of only one. You can only take one reaction per trigger.
 -You can use a bonus action to enter a defensive stance that lasts until the start of your next turn. While in your defensive stance, you have a number of special reactions equal to your proficiency bonus that you can only use to make opportunity attacks."
