A creature can be targeted by more than one wire. \r\n\r\nEach target must make a Dexterity saving throw for each wire that targets it. On a failed save, the creature is restrained and falls prone as it is wrapped securely by the wire.\r\n\r\nA creature restrained by a wire can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your tech save DC. On a success, it is no longer restrained by that wire. A wire can also be destroyed; each one has AC 15 and 10 hit points, and has immunity to all damage not dealt by melee weapons.\r\n\r\nA wire that misses its target or is escaped falls slack and disintegrates, as do all remaining wires when the power ends.",
