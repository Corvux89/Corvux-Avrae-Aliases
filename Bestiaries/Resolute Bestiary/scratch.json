On a fail, the target is pushed 10 feet, Cyborg Khagan moves into their current square ignoring opportunity attacks, and he has advantage on his next attack against them this combat. On a success, Cyborg Khagan moves into a square adjacent to the target and opportunity attacks against Cyborg Khagan have disadvantage during that move."
