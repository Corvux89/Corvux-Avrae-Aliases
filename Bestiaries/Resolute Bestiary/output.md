***Creature Sense.*** The bor gullet is aware of the presence of creatures within 1 mile of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each such creature, as well as each such creature’s intelligence score, but it can’t sense anything else about it. Droids and creatures protected by a mind blank power or other similar power cannot be perceived in this manner.

***Fortified Mind.*** The bor gullet has advantage on saving throws against being charmed and frightened, and it can’t be put to sleep.
:
***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the bor gullet fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
:
***Psychic Link.*** The bor gullet can establish a psychic link with any creature that it successfully grapples with its tentacles. Until the psychic link ends, the bor gullet can perceive everything the target senses. The target is aware that its mind is linked, and the bor gullet can terminate the link at any time (no action required). The target can use an action on its turn to attempt to break the psychic link, doing so with a successful DC 18 Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage. The psychic link also ends if the target and the bor gullet are more than 1 mile apart, with no consequences to the target. The bor gullet can form psychic links with up to ten creatures at a time.

### Actions

A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
:
***Sense Thoughts.*** The bor gullet targets a creature with which it has a psychic link. The bor gullet gains insight into the target's emotional state and any thoughts that loom large in its mind (including worries, loves, and hates). The bor gullet can also make a Charisma (Deception) check with advantage to deceive the target's mind into thinking it believes one idea or feels a particular emotion. The target contests this attempt with a Wisdom (Insight) check. If the bor gullet succeeds, the mind believes the deception for 1 hour or until evidence of the lie is presented to the target.
:



### Legendary Actions

***Detect Sentience.*** The brain worm can sense the presence and location of any creature within 300 feet of it that has an Intelligence of 3 or higher, regardless of interposing barriers, unless the creature is protected by a mind blank force power.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The brain worm makes one enter orifice attack and uses consume mind.
:
***Enter Orifice.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d4 + 2) kinetic damage.
:
***Consume Mind.*** The brain worm targets one creature it can see within 10 feet of it that has a brain. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw against this magic or take 11 (2d10) psychic damage. Also on a failure, roll 3d6: If the total equals or exceeds the target's Intelligence score, that score is reduced to 0. The target is stunned until it regains at least one point of Intelligence.
:
***Body Thief.*** The brain worm initiates an Intelligence contest with an incapacitated humanoid within 5 feet of it. If it wins the contest, the brain worm burrows into the target's brain and takes control of the target's body. While inside a creature, the brain worm has total cover against attacks and other effects originating outside its host. The brain worm retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as its understanding of Geonosian, its telepathy, and its traits. It otherwise adopts the target's statistics. It knows everything the creature knew, including force powers, tech powers, and languages. 

If the host body takes 20 points of cold damage in a single round, the brain worm must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw using its own Constitution score, not the host's. On a failure, the brain worm leaves the body, slithering out to a space within 5 feetof the host. After exiting the host, it is paralyzed until the start of its next turn. If the host body dies, the brain worm must leave it. The brain worm is also forced out if the target regains its devoured brain by means of a master heal force power. By spending 5 feet of its movement, the brain worm can voluntarily leave the body, slithering out to the nearest unoccupied space within 5 feet of it.

___
***Innate Forcecasting.*** Abeloth’s forceasting ability is Charisma (force save DC 23). Abeloth can innately cast the following force powers:
At will: coerce mind, sense force
3/day each: fear, force suppression, telekinesis
1/day each: telekinetic wave, force lightning cone
:
***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the manifestation of abeloth fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
:
***Force Resistance.*** Abeloth has advantage on saving throws against force powers and effects.
:
***Enhanced Being.*** Abeloth’s weapon attacks are enhanced.
:
***One with the Force.*** Abeloth has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, deafened, stunned, or knocked unconscious.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** Abeloth makes two tentacle attacks.
:
***Tentacles.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (3d12+9) kinetic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. If the target's hit point maximum is reduced to 0, they die and their essence is absorbed into Abeloth.
:
***Will.*** If the target fails the save, the target suffers one of the following effects of Abeloth's choice or at random: 1. Beguiling Will. The target is stunned until the start of Abeloth's next turn. 2. Hypnotic Will. The target is charmed by Abeloth until the start of Abeloth's next turn. Abeloth chooses how the charmed target uses its actions, reactions, and movement. Because this effect requires Abeloth's strong effort, she can't use her Maddening Will legendary action until the start of her next turn. 3. Insane Will. The target suffers the effect of the confusion power without making a saving throw. The effect lasts until the start of Abeloth's next turn. Abeloth doesn't need to concentrate on the power. Abeloth turns her will upon one creature she can see within 120 feet. That target must make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. Unless the target is incapacitated, it can avert it's attention to automatically succeed on the save. If the target does so, it can't see Abeloth until the start of its next turn. If the target again focuses on Abeloth in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
:



### Legendary Actions
***Draining Lightning.*** Ranged Power Attack: +17 to hit, range 15 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (2d10+9) lightning damage plus 11 (2d10) necrotic damage.
:
***Maddening Will.*** Abeloth uses her Will action, and must choose either the Beguiling Will or the Insane Will effect.

A restrained creature moves with the whirlpool and is submerged when the effect ends, unless the creature has some means to stay afloat. A restrained creature can use an action to make a DC 21 Strength or Dexterity check. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlpool and is hurled 3d6x10 feet away from it in a random direction. The whirlpool ends at the beginning of the monster's turn unless the monster used the Whirlpool legendary action to maintain the whirlpool. The monster creates a whirlpool in the water at a point within 30 feet that it can see. The whirlwind is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-deep cylinder centered on that point. On subsequent turns, the monster can use the Whirlpool legendary action to maintain and move the whirlpool up to 30 feet in any direction along the surface of the water.

***Buried.*** The sarlacc is resistant to damage from sources beyond 60 feet and immune to damage from sources beyond 120 feet.
:
***Grasping Tentacles.*** The sarlacc can have up to eight tentacles at a time. Each tentacle can be attacked (AC 18; 40 hit points; immunity to psychic damage). A tentacle can also be broken if a creature takes an action and succeeds on a DC 22 Strength check against it. Destroying a tentacle in either way deals no damage to the sarlacc, which can extrude a replacement tentacle on its next turn, but it causes the sarlacc to spend a legendary action for no effect. If the sarlacc has no legendary actions remaining this turn to spend, the sarlacc regains one fewer spent legendary actions at the start of its next turn than it would otherwise regain. The sarlacc can be forced to spend no more than two legendary actions in this way.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** The sarlacc makes three tentacle attacks, each of which it can replace with one use of Bite.
:
***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (4d8 + 8) kinetic damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The sarlacc has eight tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.
:
***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +0 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) Kinetic damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the sarlacc can't bite another target.
:
***Swallow.*** If the sarlacc takes 40 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the sarlacc must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the sarlacc. If the sarlacc dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone. The sarlacc makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the sarlacc, and it takes 35 (10d6) psychic damage at the start of each of the sarlacc's turns. A creature reduced to zero hit points this way stops taking the psychic damage and becomes stable.
:
***Pheromones (Recharge 5-6).*** The sarlacc releases pheromones in a 300 foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save the creature is charmed by the sarlacc for 1 minute. While charmed this way, the target tries to get as close to the sarlacc as possible, using its actions to Dash until it is within 5 feet of the sarlacc. A charmed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature has advantage on saving throws against the sarlacc's Pheromones for 24 hours.
:



### Legendary Actions
***Earth-Shaking Movement.*** The sarlacc sends a shockwave through the ground in a 120-foot-radius circle centered on itself. That area becomes difficult terrain for 1 round. Each creature on the ground in the area must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 41 (6d10 + 8) sonic damage and is knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage and is not knocked prone on a successful one. A creature that fails the save by 5 or more is pulled 15 feet downwards and towards the sarlacc.
:
***Reel.*** The sarlacc pulls each creature grappled by it up to 30 feet straight towards it.
:
***Tentacle.*** The sarlacc makes one tentacle attack.
:
***Chomp (Costs 2 Actions).*** The sarlacc makes one bite attack or uses its swallow.

A single fuel tank holds enough fuel for three attacks in a line or a single attack in a cone. Each creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d4+1 cold damage and gains 1 slowed level until the end of the Twisuns Legate's next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn’t slowed.

On a failed save, it dies immediately without making death saving throws. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust.
:
***Vapor Projector - Incendiary (Fine).*** When triggered, this vapor projector ammunition produces a burst of flame in a line 15 feet long and 5 feet wide or a 15-foot cone. A single fuel tank holds enough fuel for three attacks in a line or a single attack in a cone. Each creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8+1 fire damage or half as much on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.
:

### Bonus Actions
