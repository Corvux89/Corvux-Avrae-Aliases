Star Wars Level (swlevel)
  
Just like the `!level` we all know and love, but in space. Makes counters for Hit Dice and limited-use class features, and sets archetype in a `subclass` cvar.
 
__Basic Use__
`!swlevel` - Picks up class levels from your `character()` data.
`!swlevel <class> <archetype>` - Sets your archetype for the provided class.
`!swlevel <class> <level> [archetype]` - Sets the class levels for classes **not defined** in your `character()` data. 
`!swlevel <class>` - Removes class levels and archetype added by `!swlevel`. Cannot remove class levels pulled from your sheet.
