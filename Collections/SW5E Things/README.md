Aliases and snippets for the Resolute SW5E server. This is an active work in progress for the Resolute SW5E server.

Some of this are updates of R to the Ichie's work, that is either out of date, or copied over so we don't have multiple collections for the same thing. Some of this is my own work.

You can view the source code for these (plus some of my scratch work) on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Corvux89/Corvux-Avrae-Aliases).

If you like what i'm doing you can buy me a coffee on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/corvux).

If you see an issue, or have a request of something you would like added you can either do a PR to the repo, or contact me on discord
