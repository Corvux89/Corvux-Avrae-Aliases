Aliases and snippets for the Resolute SW5E server. This is an active work in progress for the Resolute SW5E server.

Some of this are updates of R to the Ichie's work, some of this is my own work. 

You can view the source code for these (plus some of my scratch work) on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Corvux89/Corvux-Avrae-Aliases).

__Setup__
Using the adapted SW5E Character sheet, [link here if you don't have it](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17majk3zixwQguF8AqsS2ZfgLm4neZaimq9vmjwniuBw/edit#gid=359784640), import in, unsing `!import <url>`
 
After importing run `!swlevel` to setup your levels, and hit die, and any customizations as defined via our [action spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V8BJrzt56jJNxRlx4daZayHBZJSQ7nrjNTavix2caSg/edit?usp=sharing). Refer to those command help texts for any specifics on running them, but this should cover your base setup. `!swequip` will help setup weapons and counters.
