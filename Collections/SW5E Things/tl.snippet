-d 1d6 -f "Target Lock|Until the power ends, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, the target gains no benefit from one-quarter, half, and three-quarters cover against you, and if the target is invisible, you can see it as if it were visible. If the target drops to 0 hit points before this power ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature."
