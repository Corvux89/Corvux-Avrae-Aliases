**Cast Powers using Force or Tech Points**

Use `!power "Power Name"` to cast a power using either Force or Tech Points. This requires a counter named "Force Points" or "Tech Points" and the power must be in your spellbook (or use `-i` to ignore requirements). This uses `!cast` as a base command, so it accepts any argument that `!help cast` lists as available.  You may modify the points cost without changing the level of the power by using `-p #`.
