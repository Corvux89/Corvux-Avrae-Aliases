Ship combat!

__Ship Sheets__
Assuming you're using a shipyard sheet for your ship tracking, there is a formula in the notes of S2 (ship string) to generate a string to import into our ship import template. [Template and formula can be found here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16ZxpqZe46-Rzb5UZDAzRunUzuk9AcShBTXVRLLsmi0c/edit?usp=sharing)
 
From there this will function just like a character to import into avrae.
 
Then you can `!ship level` to setup hit/shield die as well as custom counters (in-process), and then `!ship equip [weapon name]` to weapons. Both the level and equip commands are similar to the character equivalents. 
 
__Combat Setup__
In initiative, the plan is to setup a group with the ship name, and load up the ship sheet as well as all of the characters aboard. Then you should be able to do most actions as your character (and not the ship). `!ship a` will run actions. Pulling the actions from the ship, and adding proficiency bonuses (or not depending on parameters) to the actions. `!ship c` will do checks.
