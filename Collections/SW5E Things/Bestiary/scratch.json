While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the rancor, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the rancor's turns.\nIf the rancor takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the Rancor must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the Rancor. If the Rancor dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone."
