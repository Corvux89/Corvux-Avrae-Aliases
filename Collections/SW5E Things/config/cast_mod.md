Override the default casting stat. Only use this if you aren't following the wis/cha for force powers

This will tell`!power` to use a different modifier than what the power calls for. Ex: Stat is set here to `int`, force powers will use intelligence rather than Wis/Cha. Or set to `Wisdom` and all dark side force powers will also be cast with Wisdom.
 
`!swconfig castStat <stat> [args]`

__Available Arguments__
`-server` Set this if this should be the force power cast stat for the server.
