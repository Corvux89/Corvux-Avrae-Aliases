    "description": "You create a cloud of invisible, explosive gas that spreads out into a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see. If a source of heat--fire, sparks, or a blaster bolt, for example--is brought into contact with the cloud, the gas ignites. Each creature within the cloud's area must make a  Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d6 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the cloud explodes, this power ends \n\nThe cloud of gas can be noticed only with a successful Wisdom (Perception) check against your tech save DC.\n\n**Overcharge Tech.** If you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.",
