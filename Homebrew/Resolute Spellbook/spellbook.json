You must attach it either to a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed or turned on (such as a book, door, or computer terminal) to conceal the trap. The trap can cover an area no larger than 10 feet in diameter. At the GM's discretion, certain actions may cause the trap to break or be rendered inoperative.\r\n\r\nThe trap is well disguised, and generally and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your tech save DC to be found.\r\n\r\nYou decide what triggers the trap when you cast the power, such as entering a certain area or powering on the object. You can further refine the trigger so the trap activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight) or creature kind (for example, the trap could be set to go off only droids or gungans). You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the trap, such as those who say a certain password.\r\n\r\nYou may only have one instance of this trap active at a time. If you cast another trap before the previous one is triggered, the other trap becomes inert.\r\n\r\nWhen you create the trap, choose an explosive trap or a power trap:\r\n\r\n***Explosive Trap.*** When triggered, the trap erupts in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the trap. The explosion spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or sonic damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the trap), or half as much damage on a successful one.\r\n\r\n***Power Trap.*** You can store a prepared tech power of 3rd level or lower in the trap by casting it as part of creating the trap. The trap must target a single creature or an area. The power being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the trap is triggered, the stored power is cast. If the trap has a target, it targets the creature that triggered the trap. If the power affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the power requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.\r\n\r\n***Overcharge Tech.*** When you cast this power using a tech slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive trap increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the hallucination. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall - it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.\r\n\r\nAn affected target is so convinced of the hallucination's reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A hallucination created to appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a hallucination created to appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn, the hallucination can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the hallucination's area or within 5 feet of the hallucination, provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking.

You don't need to meet any requirements in that power; it simply takes effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\r\n- You summon one object to you of up to 250,000 cr in value that isn't an enhanced item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\r\n- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the *improved restoration* power.\r\n- You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\r\n- You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single power or other specific enhanced effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to the Manifestation of Abeloth's Will ability.\r\n- You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, *will of the force* could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\r\n\r\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This power might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary enhanced item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.\r\n\r\nThe stress of casting this power to produce any effect other than duplicating another power weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a power until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that power, which can't be reduced or prevented in any way. Additionally, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Additionally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast *will of the force* ever again if you suffer this stress. Finally, if you are reduced to 0 hit points as a result of this necrotic damage, or at any point before you have fully recovered from the Strength reduction, you immediately die and cannot be resurrected as your body fades away, absorbed into the living Force.",

On a hit, the target suffers the attack\u2019s normal effects, and you ward yourself from it through the Force.\n\nIf the target forces you to make a saving throw before the start of your next turn, the target takes an additional 1d6 psychic damage, and you can roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to your saving throw. The power then ends.\n\nThe power\u2019s damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d6 psychic damage to the target, and the psychic damage the target takes for forcing you to make a saving throw increases to 2d6. Both damage rolls increase by 1d6 at 11th level and 17th level.",

When you cast the power and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can expend a speed point, granting yourself all of the following benefits until the end of that turn:\n\nYour speed increases by 5 feet.\nYou have resistance to falling damage.\nYou ignore difficult terrain.\nYou have a climb speed equal to your walking speed.\nYou add 10 feet to your long jump distance and 3 feet to your high jump distance.\nYou can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.\nYou do not sink when moving over soft or brittle terrain, such as dust, silt, mud, snow, or thin ice. This effect does not allow you to move across liquid surfaces.\nIf you move at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hit it with a melee weapon attack for the first time on the same turn, you deal an extra 1d4 damage with that attack.\nAt the end of the turn, the benefits fade entirely until you spend another speed point. If these benefits end while you are still on a vertical surface, or anywhere else where you would normally fall or sink, you immediately fall or begin to sink unless you have some other means to remain there.\n\nThis power ends when its duration expires, when you cast this power again, or when you have spent all your speed points. When the power ends, any unspent speed points are lost.\n\nForce Potency. When you cast this power using a force slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st. In addition, if you cast this power with a force slot of 3rd level or higher, you gain one additional speed point for every two slot levels above 1st.",
