Alternatively, you can reach out through the Force, and attempt to sense the presence of a thinking creature within range that you are familiar with. If the creature you designate isn't within range, the power fails, and you do not expend any force points.\n\nThe target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take 10d6 psychic damage and be incapacitated until the start of your next turn. Whether the target passes or fails this saving throw, you immediately learn its location. This power has no effect on droids or constructs.\n\n**Force Potency.** When you cast this power using a force slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.",
